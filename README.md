# Task-1 Repository README

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Description:** RaftLabs-task2  
**Author:** Harikrishnan KP  
**License:** ISC

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for Task-2, a project developed by Harikrishnan KP for RaftLabs. Task-2 is built using various JavaScript and TypeScript technologies to create a GraphQL server with Express, Apollo Server, MongoDB with Mongoose, and other essential dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): This project relies on Node.js for server-side JavaScript and TypeScript execution.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): npm is the package manager for JavaScript and comes bundled with Node.js. You can also use Yarn as an alternative.


## Scripts

This project includes several npm scripts that simplify common development tasks:

- **npm run codegen:** Run GraphQL Code Generator to generate TypeScript typings from your GraphQL schema.
- **npm test:** Run tests (currently a placeholder script).
- **npm run dev:** Start a development server using nodemon, which automatically reloads when changes are detected in the source code.
- **npm run build:** Compile TypeScript source code into JavaScript using TypeScript's compiler (tsc).

## Dependencies

This project relies on various external libraries and dependencies, including:

- **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Apollo Server Express:** A library for building GraphQL servers with Express.
- **MongoDB:** A popular NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for your API, and a runtime for executing those queries by your server.
- **jsonwebtoken:** JSON Web Token (JWT) library for Node.js.
- **bcrypt:** A library to help you hash passwords.
- **redis:** An in-memory data structure store used as a caching mechanism.
- **socket.io:** A library for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.
